function:

fn !{1, 2} ~{2, 3} funkcja(x : |I32, y : *|I32, name : String){
	return 1;
}

!{1, 2}  - arguments 1 and 2 cannot point to the same memory
~{2, 3}  - arguments 2 and 3 commute


Special Classes:
class:
	class type
Null:
	null type
tuple:
	[[Int, Int, Float]]  - tuple containing three types, tuple doesn't guarantee alignment in memory, it cannot be referenced


*  - pointer
^  - pointer to a constant
&  - argument passer, acts like a immutable variable, in reality it is either a pointer to a constant or a variable
